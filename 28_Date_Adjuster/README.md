1.
Write TemporalAjuster, which return next Friday 13th. If we pass Friday 13th to the method, it would return the next Friday the 13th
2.
Update application PrintCalendarAppl such way that the user might select first week day. The application should allow the user to define first week day as third command line argument 
•	1 - Monday
•	2 - Tuesday
•	3 - Wednesday
•	4 - Thursday
•	5 - Friday
•	6 - Saturday 
•	7 - Sunday
If the user does not give a third argument, then the calendar starts on Monday.
